## 🔧 Code Quality

This project uses several tools to maintain code quality:

- **ESLint** with plugins:
  - `eslint-plugin-react` - React-specific rules
  - `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` - React Hooks rules
  - `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` - Accessibility rules
  - `eslint-plugin-import` - Import/export syntax rules
  - `typescript-eslint` - TypeScript rules

- **Prettier** for consistent code formatting
- **Husky** for pre-commit hooks
- **lint-staged** to run checks only on staged files

### Pre-commit Hooks

Before each commit, the following checks run automatically on staged files:

- Code formatting with Prettier
- Linting with ESLint

## 🚢 Deployment

The application is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages on every push to the `main` branch.

**Live Demo:** [Your GitHub Pages URL]

### CI/CD Pipeline

- **Deploy Action**: Runs on push to `main`, builds and deploys to GitHub Pages
- **Lint Action**: Runs on Pull Requests, checks code quality

## 🤝 Contributing

### Workflow

1. Pull the latest `main` branch
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
3. Push your branch to GitHub
4. Open a Pull Request to `main`
5. Write your code and push changes
6. Request review from teammates
7. Address review comments if needed
8. Merge after approval

### Branch Protection Rules

The `main` branch is protected:

- ✅ Requires pull request reviews before merging
- ✅ Requires status checks to pass (linting)
- ✅ No direct pushes allowed
- ✅ No force pushes

### Code Style Guidelines

- Use **CSS Modules** for styling
- Keep `.module.scss` files together with components
- Each component in separate folder with `index.ts`, `ComponentName.tsx`, `ComponentName.module.scss`
- Use **TypeScript** for type safety
- Follow **ESLint** and **Prettier** rules

## 📊 Data Structure

### Product Object

```typescript
{
  id: string; // Required for fetching details
  name: string; // Product name
  image: string; // Link to image (relative to public folder)
  price: number; // Current price
  fullPrice: number; // Original price (for discount)
  year: number; // Used for sorting by newest
  capacity: string; // e.g., "64GB"
  color: string; // e.g., "black"
}
```
